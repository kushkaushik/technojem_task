In Techno_jem taks_1 leetcode problem the first three problem are very easy:
                                                                          1486. XOR Operation in an Array
                                                                          1768. Merge Strings Alternately
                                                                          804. Unique Morse Code Words
                                                                          
These three problems are little bit very easy problem. in these problems i don't need to think about anymore :

I face difficulity when i try to:
                                
                                1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix
                                                                => firstly i try to understand the problem statement then i try to find the minimum number of the each matrix
                                                                and then compare b/w them and find the answer of the maximum of these 3 :
                                                                Like Here:->
                                                                [ 3  7  8
                                                                  9 11 13
                                                                  15 16 17]
                                                                here firstly i find the minimum of these three rows : and then i try to think vo evaluating :
                                                                it it True for some test cases but not for all:
                                                                
                                                                Then the second thinking  problem is to find the maximum of all these columns. for column traversal i think about 5
                                                                to 10 min. then next step it simply find wheater element exist or not in the previous vector array or not. :
 About next problem i can't even understand that problem.
